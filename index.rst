|p4d| Documentation
===================

This documentation is intended for users and administrators of |p4d|, a set of software tools for creating corpora from scanned documents in DjVu format, such as digitalized dictionaries. 

Throughout the instructions it's assumed thay you're using a GNU/Linux system.
In theory it should be possible to run all the described software on Windows, but it might require some additional effort, and it's not discussed here.

If you find any bugs in the documentation or you want to suggest any additions, feel free to mail the `author <mailto:r.moszczynski@uw.edu.pl>`_.
