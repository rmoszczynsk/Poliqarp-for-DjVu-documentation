Poliqarp for DjVu was developed by Jakub Wilk based on ideas and specification by Janusz S. Bień. 
Development was supported by the Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education's grant no. N N519 384036. 

Some of the material is based on previous instructions created in Polish by Janusz S. Bień, Krzysztof Szafran, and Tomasz Olejniczak. 
Numerous comments and valuable additions were contributed by Janusz S. Bień and Jakub Wilk.

Configuration samples for Marasca are based on Jakub Wilk's original installation for the `Virtual Lexicographical Library <http://poliqarp.wbl.klf.uw.edu.pl>`_ hosted by the Department of Formal Linguistics at the University of Warsaw.
